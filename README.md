üéØ Purpose

This guide helps:

Researchers explore available AI tools and frameworks.

Developers find starting points (official repos, APIs, SDKs).

Learners distinguish between conceptual AI agents and those with working demos/tools.



‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

Some entries are marked Conceptual where no direct public implementation is available.

Links may point to closest available implementations or related research papers.
